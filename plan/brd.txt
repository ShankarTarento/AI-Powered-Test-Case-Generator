# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

The objective of this product is to build a **SaaS-based AI-powered Test Case Management Platform** that integrates with **Jira** to automatically generate, manage, and analyze test cases based on user stories. The platform leverages historical manually-written test cases as training/reference data to continuously improve test case quality for future sprints.

The product aims to:

* Reduce manual QA effort
* Improve test coverage and consistency
* Provide sprint-level visibility and analytics
* Act as a unified dashboard for QA + Product + Engineering teams

* Weak traceability between user stories, test cases, and execution status
* Limited sprint-level analytics for QA effectiveness
* Context switching between Jira and test management tools

---

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Business Goals

* Reduce test case creation effort by 60–70%
* Improve test coverage and standardization
* Enable faster sprint readiness and releases

### Product Goals
