## 11. Risk Management During Development

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: AI Generation Too Slow**
- **Threshold:** >10 seconds per story
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use GPT-3.5 for simple stories
  - Implement parallel generation for batches
  - Add caching layer
  - Stream responses to user (show progress)
- **Contingency:** Use pre-generated templates for common story types

**Risk 2: Jira API Rate Limits Hit**
- **Threshold:** >100 requests/min
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement webhook-first sync
  - Batch requests (10-sec delay)
  - Use multiple API tokens for large orgs
  - Cache aggressively (5-min TTL)
- **Contingency:** Graceful degradation (show stale data with warning)

**Risk 3: Vector DB (Qdrant) Performance**
- **Threshold:** Search >2 seconds
- **Mitigation:**
  - Optimize index parameters
  - Use filters to reduce search space
  - Scale Qdrant horizontally
  - Implement query caching
- **Contingency:** Fall back to simple keyword search

**Risk 4: High AI Costs**
- **Threshold:** >$1 per story generation
- **Mitigation:**
  - Smart caching (80% cache hit rate)
  - Use smaller models for simple stories
  - Implement token limits per tier
  - Batch API calls
- **Contingency:** Reduce context window size, use open-source models

### Team Risks

**Risk 5: Key Engineer Leaves**
- **Mitigation:**
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Pair programming sessions
  - Code review requirements
  - Knowledge sharing sessions
- **Contingency:** Have backup engineers familiar with each area

**Risk 6: Timeline Slippage**
- **Early Warning Signs:**
  - Sprint velocity declining
  - Stories carry over 2+ sprints
  - Critical bugs accumulating
- **Mitigation:**
  - Weekly sprint reviews
  - Cut scope aggressively
  - Prioritize ruthlessly (80/20 rule)
  - Communicate early with stakeholders
- **Contingency:** Delay launch or cut Phase 5 features

### Product Risks

**Risk 7: Low Beta User Adoption**
- **Threshold:** <50% beta users active after Week 1
- **Mitigation:**
  - Proactive onboarding support
  - Weekly check-ins
  - Quick fixes for blockers
  - Incentivize participation
- **Contingency:** Extend beta period, recruit new users

**Risk 8: AI Accuracy Below Expectations**
- **Threshold:** <60% approval rate
- **Mitigation:**
  - A/B test different prompts
  - Increase few-shot examples
  - Fine-tune on domain data
  - Set conservative confidence thresholds
- **Contingency:** Position as "draft generator" not "auto-generator"

## Appendix: Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Monorepo vs Multi-Repo
**Decision:** Monorepo (recommended)
- **Pros:** Easier code sharing, unified versioning, simpler CI/CD
- **Cons:** Larger repo size, requires good tooling
- **Tool:** Nx / Turborepo / Lerna

### 2. Backend Framework
**Decision:** Python FastAPI
- **Pros:** Fast, async, great for AI integration, OpenAPI auto-gen
- **Cons:** Python ecosystem can be tricky
- **Alternative:** Node.js (Express/NestJS) if team prefers JS

### 3. Frontend Framework
**Decision:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Pros:** Most popular, great ecosystem, type safety
- **Cons:** Can be verbose
- **Alternative:** Next.js (if need SSR), Vue 3 (simpler)

### 4. LLM Provider
**Decision:** OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (primary) + Anthropic Claude (fallback)
- **Pros:** Best quality, good docs, reliable APIs
- **Cons:** Cost, vendor lock-in
- **Mitigation:** Abstraction layer, open-source fallback

### 5. Vector Database
**Decision:** Qdrant
- **Pros:** Fast, self-hosted, good Python support
- **Cons:** Relatively new
- **Alternative:** Pinecone (managed), Weaviate

### 6. Deployment
**Decision:** Kubernetes (AWS EKS or Azure AKS)
- **Pros:** Industry standard, scalable, resilient
- **Cons:** Complex to manage
- **Alternative:** Simpler: AWS ECS Fargate, Google Cloud Run

### 7. State Management (Frontend)
**Decision:** Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **Pros:** Simple, lightweight, TypeScript-friendly
- **Cons:** Less structure than Redux
- **Alternative:** React Query for server state
